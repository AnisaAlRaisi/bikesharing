## Overview:
### Purpose:
This project aimed to produce data analysis on NYC bike-sharing to convince investors to invest in a  bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

## Results:
### Checkout Times for Users Vizualisation:

The graph shows that male users have the highest amount of bike rides.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Vizualisation:

The visualization shows that most bike rides happen on weekday mornings, 8 am, and weekday evenings starting at 5 pm. This analysis could suggest that people use bikes to get to work and back. During the weekends, there is a high amount of bikes used from 10 am to 7 pm, which suggests that users utilize bike-sharing for leisure purposes.
 
###  Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Vizualisation:

This visualization reflects the last two, where males have the highest bike shares during morning and early evening times.

### Trips by Gender by Weekday Vizualisation:

## Summary:
The results show that the highest number of bikes checked out is male subscribers; they also show that users utilize bike-sharing as transportation to and from work. This analysis indicates an opportunity for marketing bike-sharing in areas with a lot of offices. I would suggest creating more visualizations on sites with offices and how people in Des Moines travel to and from work.
